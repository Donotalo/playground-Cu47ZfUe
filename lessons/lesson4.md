## String concatenation - `strcat`

The `strcat` function is used to append one string (source) at the end of another string (destination). It does the following:

1. Takes the destination string.
2. Finds the NULL character.
3. Copies the source string starting at the location of the NULL character of destination string.
4. Appends a NULL character to the destination string when all characters of the source string are copied to the destination string.
